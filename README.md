# Dotfiles Repository

This repository contains my personal dotfiles and configurations.

## Machine/Distribution Specific Commands/Scripts

The machine or distribution specific commands and scripts are organized in their respective folders. For example, all installation specifics for Arch Linux can be found in the 'arch' folder.

## App-Specific Configurations

The app-specific configurations, such as Starship, are stored in the 'config' folder.

Feel free to explore the repository and use any configurations that you find useful.
